        <p>This is my third assignment for my Object Oriented Programming class in 2nd year of DIT Computer Science. For this assignment I made a top down shooter game in the vain of Asteroids or Space War using the Unity game engine.</p>

<p>The models I made from scratch in Blender, then created simple textures to apply to them before bringing them across to Unity. The bullets and powerups were just made in Unity itself since they were just basic shapes and 1 colour.</p>

<p>All of the scripting is done with C# which I hadn't used before attempting this project but it is very similar to other languages I've used so it was an easy adjustment.</p>

<p>I used Unity to build the game into an executable .exe file which can be downloaded from this site and launched without needing the Unity project.</p>
